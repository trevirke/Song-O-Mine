            <p>She's got a smile that it seems to me <br>Reminds me of childhood memories<br> Where everything Was as fresh as the bright blue sky<br> Now and then when I see her face<br> She takes me away to that special place <br>And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry<br> Oh Sweet child o' mine Oh Sweet love of mine</p><br>
            <p>She's got eyes of the bluest skies<br> As if they thought of rain <br>I hate to look into those eyes<br> And see an ounce of pain<br> Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place<br> Where as a child I'd hide<br> And pray for the thunder<br> And the rain to quietly pass me by<br> Oh Sweet child o' mine Oh Sweet love of mine /x2</p><br>
