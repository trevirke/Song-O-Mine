            <p>She's got a smile that it seems to me Reminds me of childhood memories Where everything Was as fresh as the bright blue sky Now and then when I see her face She takes me away to that special place And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry Oh Sweet child o' mine Oh Sweet love of mine </p>
            <p>She's got eyes of the bluest skies As if they thought of rain I hate to look into those eyes And see an ounce of pain Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place Where as a child I'd hide And pray for the thunder And the rain to quietly pass me by Oh Sweet child o' mine Oh Sweet love of mine /x2</p>
